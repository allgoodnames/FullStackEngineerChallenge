Full Stack Engineer Challenge

Usually I work mostly with AngularJS against a Java backend, but I figured that
regardless of my application I would make it a learning experience, and I have
been eager to do something with a more modern framework, so I made my front-end
stack VueJS with Vuex for state handling, and Axios for API calls. For the
backend I picked NodeJS, with Express and Mongoose against a remote Mongo
database in order to minimize the amount of time I would have to spend building
that.

As far as assumptions go, I assumed that all employees created in the system
would be non-admin users, and that reviews and feedback would only be carried
out on those users.

I didn't have enough time to finish half of the views, implement any real security,
proper session handling, delete confirmation, and there is also no edit
functionality for either employees or reviews. The styling is also only about
halfway there. ObjectIDs would probably have been better than strings for
the DB schemas, but again I didn't have enough time. These are things I would
change if I was doing a real project and wasn't doing this beside my normal work
tasks.
